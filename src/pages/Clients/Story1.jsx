            The client had recently rolled out a successful online subscription based service which caused a surge in the volume of transactions & client activity. Their platform was aging and could not scale up to handle the volume. This led to unhappy customers with outages as well as slow response times.

            <p>
            <span style={{ color: '#00FFB3' }}>The Outcome: {'\u00A0'} </span>
            By modernizing their core platform & migrating their core platform on the cloud we were able to scale up their platform 70x from 10 tps (transactions per second) to 700 tps. In addition we saw a 93% reduction in support requests due to outages which resulted in direct cost savings, and a 53% reduction in response times for their users. Rayze enabled the client to achieve their growth ambitions
