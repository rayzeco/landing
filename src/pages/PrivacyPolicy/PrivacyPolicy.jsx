We are dedicated to respecting and safeguarding your personal data, which encompasses any information capable of identifying you as an individual. This Privacy Policy delineates our approach to managing and securing your personal data within the scope of Rayze's business activities, covering conferences, events, and client services, across various platforms such as websites, applications, and communications associated with this Privacy Policy (collectively termed "the Sites").

      <h4>Information we collect</h4>

      During its business operations, Rayze acquires personal data, including information related to specific client services. This data is obtained when individuals register for jobs through the Rayze Recruitment Portal, create user profiles, subscribe to Rayze newsletters and alerts, engage in alumni activities via the Alumni Center Website, sign up for conferences and events, and participate in public user posting areas like bulletin boards, discussion forums, and surveys. The gathered personal data may include details provided by users, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and background information necessary for job applications.

Additionally, we automatically collect information about the devices used to interact with our Sites. This may encompass IP addresses, device identifiers, web browsers, and browsing details obtained through technologies like cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear gifs, and others collectively referred to as "Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies." We also gather information about users' interactions with the Sites, such as search queries and viewed content. The automatically collected data may be linked to a unique identifier, as well as any other provided personal data.

Rayze may obtain personal data from third parties, such as data brokers or aggregators, as part of its business activities and specific client services. This includes demographic and professional information publicly available online, including details shared on social media platforms and other public forums. This data may be combined with existing information or used independently for benchmarking and data analytics purposes, such as analyzing recruiting practices, detecting fraud patterns in financial transactions, and evaluating foot traffic in retail environments. Rayze ensures that third parties transparently disclose their use of this data, including its disclosure to entities like Rayze, in compliance with applicable law.

In specific cases, personal data collection is vital for Site operation or is used in business activities, like certain client services or providing products such as benchmarking products. We may analyze and combine personal data to tailor content and services for relevance and retain your data for contact purposes.
