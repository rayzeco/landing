## Slide 2: Problem Statement

### For Hiring Managers
- **Problem**: Hiring managers struggle to find top-tier IT talent quickly in a competitive market. Traditional recruiting agencies are slow, opaque, and often mismatch candidates to job requirements, leading to prolonged vacancies and lost productivity.
  - **Pain Points**:
    - **Time-Consuming Processes**: Screening, interviewing, and vetting take weeks, delaying critical projects.
    - **Lack of Transparency**: Limited visibility into candidate skills, code quality, or fit beyond resumes.
    - **Quality Gaps**: Agencies push unqualified candidates, forcing managers to redo evaluations.
  - **Rayze Solution**: Rayze automates sourcing, vetting, and matching with AI-driven technical tests, delivering pre-evaluated candidates with test results, code samples, and job-match profiles in days, not weeks.

### For HR Recruiting Teams
- **Problem**: HR teams are overwhelmed by manual recruiting tasks and inconsistent agency performance, making it hard to meet hiring goals while ensuring quality and diversity.
  - **Pain Points**:
    - **Inefficient Workflows**: Juggling multiple agencies, resumes, and interviews strains resources.
    - **Inconsistent Candidate Quality**: Agencies vary in vetting rigor, leading to poor hires or rejections.
    - **Bias and Compliance Risks**: Manual processes risk bias, and onboarding compliance is complex.
  - **Rayze Solution**: Rayze’s platform streamlines recruiting with automated vetting, bias-reducing AI evaluations, and transparent candidate data (test scores, match profiles). HR teams focus on strategy, not admin, while ensuring compliance and diversity.

**Key Insight**: Hiring managers and HR teams need speed, transparency, and quality. Rayze’s AI platform eliminates manual bottlenecks, delivering vetted, high-fit IT talent with unmatched efficiency.
